# HomeHeartBeat
Code to connect to a (long orphaned, long discontinued) Home Automation / Monitoring System 
called "Home HeartBeat" by the Eaton Corporation.

From the Vendor's 2006 PDF : 
"Home Heartbeat is a network of wireless sensors that monitor and report the status of up to 30 sensors in the home. 
The sensors relay status information to the Home Heartbeat Base Station, which then relays the information to you. You
can choose how you want to receive information from the Base Station, either as Alerts on a cell phone or as 
Real-time Status, via a broadband connection."



Eaton abandoned the system in 2011, and the hardware went on firesale.

Building upon the fantastic work of Kolinahr (https://www.kolinahr.com/the-home-heartbeat-by-eaton-post-mortem/) and Steve
Davidson (http://buzzdavidson.com/?cat=20), this is my code to connect my Home Heartbeat system into my MQTT based, Complex
Event Processing system.
